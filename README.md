# The-generator-of-buggy-OBJ-objects

Not so long ago, I wanted to make a [buggy pit](https://www.reddit.com/r/backrooms/comments/1dmbht6/locations_for_level_0_in_the_backrooms/) in backrooms, but it didn't work out very well... I just made a pit and generated a lot of triangles there that I stretched buggy textures on, and it didn't look very much like a buggy pit... According to the idea, if we jump into this pit, it can either tear you into atoms with a 50 percent probability, or through nocliping throw you into the void space where you will fly at great speed for millions of kilometers until you randomly hook a random corridor.

And not so long ago, when I wanted to generate Delaunay triangulation, I accidentally got a generator of buggy objects, and I thought maybe someone would need it?
